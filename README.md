#Account Management Software Systems

This application is intended to keep track of all the bills and payments
received by a company over a period of time.

It can also keep track of the customers pending amount. All the bills and payments
of individual customers can be seen. Moreover a yearly ledger provides for an
excellent tool for auditing purposes. It is a useful piece of software
for small businesses that only want a small subset of what is available from
the larger softwares.

This project was done as part of S5 Database Management Systems Project.
